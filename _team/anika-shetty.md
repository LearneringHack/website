Notre Dame High School student Anika has a passion for math. When she's not cracking math equations, she's diving into the fantastical worlds of manga and anime. Computers are easier for her than people, which is why she loves coding. And, of course, no high schooler is complete without a love for good food â€“ especially a plate of amazing pasta!
