# Hack learning
### Build tools for students, teachers and parents

LearningHack is a hackathon focused on creating innovative applications to simplify the lives of students, teachers, and parents.

In an all-day event, talented female/non-binary students from the Bay Areaâ€™s high and middle schools collaborate, brainstorm, and build practical solutions.
