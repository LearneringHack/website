# Learning Hack Code of Conduct
This is the Code of Conduct that we expect all Learning Hack participants to abide by.

### TL;DR
Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated.

### The Code of Conduct
At Learning Hack, we believe that every participant has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.
Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. All attendees (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Learning Hack may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or online platforms being used during the hackathon with no eligibility for reimbursement, refund or swag of any type.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact learninghack2024@gmail.com using the reporting procedures defined below.
We expect participants to follow these rules.

### Reporting Procedures
If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately using one of the following methods. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.
By sending us an email to learninghack2024@gmail.com, your report will be received by our organizers. If you want to remain anonymous please send us an email through an anonymous email service or create a temporary email account.
Learning Hack reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part.
