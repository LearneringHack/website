# About

At Learning Hack, we are dedicated to being the all-female and non-binary middle school/high school hackathon in the Bay Area. Our mission is to close the gender gap in technology and inspire creativity. In a world where only 28% of coders were women in 2022.

Learning Hack is committed to empowering young women/non-binary students from diverse backgrounds. Regardless of whether they are experienced coders or new to coding, we will provide a learning environment that will build upon their skills.

We will develop evolutionary learning experiences in the computer science field, building a future without gender boundaries in technology.
